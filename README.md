# Plan Seating Arrangement Algorith
A Ruby algorithm for allocating the seats to Airline Passengers

The seats will be allocated to the passengers in a flight based on the following input and rules.

Rules for seating:

• Always seat passengers starting from the front row to back, starting from the left to the right
• Fill aisle seats first followed by window seats followed by center seats (any order in center seats)

Input to the program will be:

• a 2D array that represents the rows and columns [[3,4], [4,5], [2,3], [3,4]]. This 2D array is just an example. The input to the program will be a dynamic 2D array.
• Number of passengers waiting in queue.
